Task: Identify and Categorize Explicit Non-Functional Requirements

Objective
Analyze the provided description and extract only the explicitly mentioned non-functional requirements (NFRs), categorizing them into one of the following types:

maintainability:
Related to how easy it is to update, modify, or fix the system. Examples include modularity, code readability, and support for future changes.

performance:
Covers system speed, responsiveness, and resource efficiency. Includes requirements like "must respond within 2 seconds" or "should handle 10,000 users concurrently."

security:
Addresses protection of data and systems from unauthorized access, breaches, or vulnerabilities. Includes encryption, authentication, and access control mechanisms.

usability:
Refers to how intuitive and user-friendly the system is. Includes requirements for accessibility, simplicity, UI/UX standards, and user satisfaction.

documentation:
Related to the quality, completeness, or availability of system documentation for developers, users, or maintainers.

correctness:
Refers to the system's ability to consistently produce accurate results and behave according to specification under all defined conditions.

none:
Use this only if the requirement is clearly a non-functional requirement but doesn’t fit any of the categories above.




What to Identify
Non-functional requirements define the quality attributes, constraints, and operational expectations of a system beyond its functional capabilities. You must extract only NFRs that are explicitly stated in the input description—avoid assumptions or inferred requirements.

Expected Output Format
For each identified non-functional requirement, return a structured JSON object containing:

"type": One of the specified categories above.

"requirement": A clear and concise description of the explicitly stated requirement.


Input Description
Below is the description to analyze. Extract only the explicitly stated non-functional requirements and categorize them accordingly.
